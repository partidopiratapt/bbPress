bbPress is forum software with a twist from the creators of WordPress.

== Description ==

Have you ever been frustrated with forum or bulletin board software that was slow, bloated and always got your server hacked? bbPress is focused on web standards, ease of use, ease of integration, and speed.

We're keeping things as small and light as possible while still allowing for great add on features through WordPress's extensive plugin system. What does all that mean? bbPress is lean, mean, and ready to take on any job you throw at it.

== Installation ==

1. Place 'bbpress' folder in your plugins directory.
2. Activate bbPress.
3. Visit your Forums settings and configure your forums.
4. Activate a bbPress compatible theme
